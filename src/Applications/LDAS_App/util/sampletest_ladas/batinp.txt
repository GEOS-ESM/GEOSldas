# REQUIRED inputs
#
# NOTE:
# - account          = computational project number
#                      [At NCCS: Use command "getsponsor" to see available account number(s).]
# - walltime         = walltime requested; format is HH:MM:SS (hours/minutes/seconds)
# - ntasks_model     = number of processors requested for the model (typically 112; output server is not included)
# - ntasks-per-node  = number of tasks per node (typically 46 for cascade lake*, 40 for skylake, and 28 for haswell nodes)
#                      [If >40, cascade lake nodes will be allocated, if >28, cascade or skylake, else cascade, skylake or haswell.]
#                      [*NCCS recommends <=46 cores per node on SCU16 (cascade lake) due to OS issues (as of 6 Oct 2021).]

# OPTIONAL inputs
#
# NOTE:
# - job_name   = name of experiment; default is "exp_id"
# - qos        = quality-of-service; do not specify by default; specify "debug" for faster but limited service.
# - oserver_nodes    = number of nodes for oserver ( default is 0 )
# - writers-per-node = tasks per oserver_node for writing ( default is 5 ),
#      IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT: total #writers = writers-per-node * oserver_nodes >= 2
#      Jobs will hang when oserver_nodes = writers-per-node = 1.
