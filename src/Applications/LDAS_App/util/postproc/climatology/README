The scripts in this directory are used to generate climatology data from GEOSldas output.

L4_SM Application:
------------------
Post-process GEOSldas output into the soil moisture climatology nc4 file needed by the 
SMAP L4SM ops system's "prcntl.py" script, which generates the soil moisture percentile 
output ("sm_rootzone_pctl", "sm_profile_pctl") in the L4SM "Geophysical" (gph) file 
collection.  
The soil moisture climatology file needed by "prcntl.py" is created in two steps: 

1) Execute "Run_L4_sm_clim_stats.m" to create pentad binary climatology files 
   (73 for "sm_rootzone" + 73 for "sm_profile").

2) Execute "Write_L4_sm_clim_stat_bin2nc4.m" to create the single L4 input netcdf file
   (*after* all binary pentad files are done). 

These jobs are memory intensive and typically take hours to run.  On Discover, it is 
necessary to use designated compute nodes.  Step 1 may need to be run separately for 
root-zone and profile soil moisture.
