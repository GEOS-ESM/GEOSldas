#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%#


# ---- Using Catchment/CatchmentCN offline?
#
#    0: DEFAULT for GCM,      (WW,CH,CM,CQ,FR) are required in Catchment restart file 
#    1: DEFAULT for GEOSldas, (WW,CH,CM,CQ,FR) are optional
#    2: Option  for GEOSldas, (WW,CH,CM,CQ,FR) are optional for input restart but will be in output
#                               restart; select when using GEOSldas to create restarts for the GCM.
#
CATCHMENT_OFFLINE: 1

# ---- Choice of land surface model
#
#    1 : Catchment model   (default)
#    2 : CatchmentCN model
#
LSM_CHOICE: 1


# ---- Domain definition
#
#      The domain is determined by specifying a lat/lon rectangle in conjunction
#      with ExcludeList and IncludeList files.  The files contain the IDs of tiles to
#      be excluded and included in the domain.
#      Included are all tiles within the rectangle or the IncludeList but not in the ExcludeList.
#      In case of conflict, the ExcludeList takes precedence.
#      The default is a GLOBAL (land) domain.
#
#      Specify extremities of lat/lon rectangle:
#         Max lat/lon range: lon=-180:180, lat=-90:90.
#      If only IncludeList should be used, specify dummy values such that:
#         MINLON > MAXLON and MINLAT > MAXLAT.
#
# MINLON: -180.
# MAXLON:  180.
# MINLAT:  -90.
# MAXLAT:   90.
#
#      Path and filenames for ExcludeList and IncludeList files.
#      (May leave blank.)
#
# EXCLUDE_FILE: '' 
# INCLUDE_FILE: '' 


# ---- Surface meteorological forcing: Horizonal interpolation 
#
#    1 :  bilinear interpolation (default)
#    0 :  nearest neighbor
#
MET_HINTERP: 1


# ---- Specify if running model only or data assimilation
#
#  NO  : model only, with or without perturbations (default)
#  YES : assimilation (full land analysis or just processing of obs for "innovations" output)
#
LAND_ASSIM: NO


# ---- Perturbations: On/off 
#
# If num_ensemble > 1, PERTURBATIONS will automatically be set to 1. 
#
#    0 : No perturbactions.
#    1 : With perturbations.
#
PERTURBATIONS: 0

# ---- Perturbations: ID of first ensemble member
#
FIRST_ENS_ID: 0


# ---- Path to special namelist input files
#
#      Applies only for ensemble simulations. The variable values in the special 
#      namelist overwrite the DEFAULT values. There may be three files: 
#          LDASsa_SPECIAL_inputs_ensupd.nml 
#          LDASsa_SPECIAL_inputs_ensprop.nml 
#          LDASsa_SPECIAL_inputs_catbias.nml 
#
# NML_INPUT_PATH: ''


# ---- Microwave Radiative Transfer Model (mwRTM) parameter file name (nc4 format)
#
#      Must be provided for
#          - output of Tb through HISTORY or
#          - Tb assimilation.
#      Otherwise, leave unspecified (i.e., use default empty string).
#
#      This file can be converted from binary with the program mwrtm_bin2nc4.x. 
#      If empty or commented out, GEOSldas will search the restart directory.
#
# MWRTM_FILE: ''


# ---- Job segments: Length
#
#      Specify period between GEOSldas.x shutdown and restart.
#      Default is the entire simulation period (END_DATE minus BEG_DATE).
#      Format:            yyyymmdd hhmmss
#
# JOB_SGMT: 00000100 000000

# ---- Job segments: Number
#
#      One lenkf.j job simulates NUM_SGMT*JOB_SGMT time, then re-submits itself,
#      so (NUM_SGMT*JOB_SGMT) should be done within the 12 hour CPU time limit (at NCCS).
#      Low values for NUM_SGMT are recommended for run-time and storage efficiency.
#      Default is 1.
#
# NUM_SGMT: 1


# ---- CHECKPOINT file output
#
#      By default, CHECKPOINT (restart) files are are written at the end of each job segment. 
#      Restart files can also be written before exiting GEOSldas.x. 
#      The following resource parameters specify the frequency and reference time and date.
#
# RECORD_FREQUENCY: 0240000              # hhhmmss          (can be greater than 1 day!)
# RECORD_REF_TIME:   000000              #  hhmmss          (reference time-of-day)
# RECORD_REF_DATE:  19790101 000000      # yyyymmdd hhmmss  (date/time after which checkpoints are written)


# ---- Output: Write log file (YES/NO)?
#
LDAS_logit: YES

# ---- Output: HISTORY definition of model diagnostics
#
#      User-defined path and filename of output (HISTORY) specification file.
#      If empty, ldas_setup will generate a default HISTORY.rc file.
#
# HISTRC_FILE: ''

# ---- Concatenate sub-daily nc4 files into daily nc4 files and write monthly-mean output?
#
#      Optional post-processing of model diagnostics output into bundled daily files and monthly means.
#      Reduces the file count and (optionally) the output volume.
#
#      Accurate monthly-means of time-average Collections require setting "ref_time" to "000000" in HISTRC_FILE!
#
#    0 : No post-processing (default).
#    1 : For complete days, concatenate (bundle) sub-daily nc4 files, if any, into daily nc4 files.  
#        For complete months, write monthly-mean nc4 files.  
#    2 : As in 1, but delete daily nc4 files.
#
# POSTPROC_HIST: 0


# ---- Name of file containing Surface GridComp resource parameters 
#
SURFRC: LDAS.rc


#--------------------------------------------------------#
# Do not change the following parameters in GEOSldas     #

# ---- No dycore for offline
#
DYCORE: none

# ---- For MAPL_RestartOptional

MAPL_ENABLE_BOOTSTRAP: YES
